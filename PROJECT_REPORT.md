## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background of the Topic

The exponential growth of biomedical literature has created unprecedented challenges for researchers attempting to stay current with relevant publications. PubMed, the premier database for biomedical literature, contains over 35 million citations, making manual literature review increasingly impractical. Simultaneously, industry-academic collaborations have become crucial drivers of biomedical innovation, particularly in pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors.

Traditional search methods often fail to effectively identify papers with meaningful industry involvement, leading to missed opportunities for collaboration and incomplete understanding of research landscapes. The integration of artificial intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), presents an opportunity to revolutionize how researchers discover, analyze, and understand scientific literature.

### 1.2 Importance and Relevance

Industry-academic collaborations are vital for:
- **Translation of Research**: Converting academic discoveries into practical applications
- **Funding Opportunities**: Identifying potential industry partners for research funding
- **Innovation Acceleration**: Bridging the gap between theoretical research and market applications
- **Career Development**: Understanding industry involvement in specific research areas

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical importance of rapid industry-academic collaboration, as seen in vaccine development partnerships between pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions.

### 1.3 Objective of the Project/Report

This project aims to develop an intelligent research discovery platform that:
1. Automatically identifies papers with industry-academic collaborations
2. Provides AI-powered insights and trend analysis
3. Enhances search queries using natural language processing
4. Delivers comprehensive research summaries and recommendations
5. Offers an intuitive web interface for efficient research workflow
